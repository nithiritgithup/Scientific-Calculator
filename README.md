# Scientific Calculator

## Project Overview

The Scientific Calculator is a console-based application designed to perform advanced mathematical operations. In addition to basic arithmetic functions, it supports exponential calculations, square roots, logarithms, and trigonometric functions. This project aims to provide a comprehensive tool for performing various mathematical operations from the command line.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Exponential Calculations**: Compute powers of numbers.
- **Square Root Calculation**: Find the square root of a number.
- **Logarithms**: Calculate logarithms with a specified base.
- **Trigonometric Functions**: Calculate sine, cosine, and tangent of angles in degrees.
- **Error Handling**: Manage invalid inputs and special cases (e.g., division by zero, logarithm of non-positive numbers).

## Installation

No special installation is required. This project is compatible with Python 3.x. Ensure that Python is installed on your computer.

## Getting Started

### File Structure

Create a directory for your project and navigate into it. Inside the directory, create a Python file named `scientific_calculator.py`.

### Running the Project

1. Save the project code in a file named `scientific_calculator.py`.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where `scientific_calculator.py` is saved.
4. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash
   python scientific_calculator.py
   ```

### Usage

1. **Select Operation**: The application will present a menu with available operations. Choose the desired function by entering the corresponding number.
2. **Enter Inputs**: Follow the prompts to input the required numbers or parameters for the selected operation.
3. **View Result**: The result of the operation will be displayed.
4. **Exit**: Choose the option to exit the calculator.

## Tips for Enhancement

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Enhance user experience by implementing a GUI using Tkinter or another GUI library.
- **Additional Mathematical Functions**: Expand the functionality to include more advanced mathematical operations, such as factorials or hyperbolic functions.
- **Improved Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling to manage a wider range of invalid inputs and edge cases.
